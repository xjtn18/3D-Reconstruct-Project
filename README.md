# 3D-Reconstruct-Project
A 2D image to 3D model pipeline

## What it does :
With this program, I solved the problem of taking a <b>physical object</b> from the <b>real world</b> and representing it as a <b>3D model</b> on a <b>computer</b>.  
Rather than doing this manually, this code (<i>given some helpful pictures of the object</i>) can build that model for you.

Here are some final renders of the <b>mannequin model</b> I generated throughout this project:
